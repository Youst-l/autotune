# Translating Autotune to your language

We are using [i18n-js](https://github.com/fnando/i18n-js) to translate the user interface.
This library provides translation facilites using the same mechanism as the Rails I18n API.


## Getting started:

Copy the file _config/locales/autotune.yml_ to _config/locales/autotune-mylang.yml_ and edit as needed. Keep in mind that
you *need* to change the 'en:' key to 'mylang:' in order to avoid overwriting other languages.

This file can be either inside Autotune or your own application. Alternatively, you can add them inside the main
autotune.yml file.

To set the language within an initializer (for example a file under _config/initializers/locale.rb_) do:

```ruby
I18n.default_locale = :mylang
```

Restart the application and it should work (missing keys will default to their English values).
